        Hi, I’m Heela.</br></br>
        I’m a UX/UI Designer student and tattoo artist with over 3 years' experience. I have a bachelor's in Jewelry design and Fine Art and expecting to get a master's degree in UX/UI design in 2024.</br></br>
        I’ve always been fascinated by opportunities that can further enhance my knowledge and that can be developed upon my current capability as an artist. I believe design is an important means of connecting the present to the future, therefore I wanted to delve into UI/UX which is closely related to the modern world and crucial to the future going forward.</br></br>
        I have realized that UI/UX design not only pertains to the beauty aspect of the design but also to the convenience of the users which I would like to explore further in depth.</br>
        I strongly believe that my experiences and eagerness in design and learning will lead me to succeed in the new opportunity to learn my area of interest.
